Legacy code review

1. Functionality and Correctness: (1)
  - Functionality is almost correct, code works quite well
  - Small errors were recognized (none of them were critical)
2. Code Clarity and Readability: (2)
  - Relatively easy to understand
  - Names are descriptive enough to easily understand the code
  - No comments were needed thanks to appropriate variable and function naming
3. Code Structure and Modularity: (1)
  - The modularity seems to be quite good
  - Overly complex or monolithic functions were not recognized
  - Components are small, but it could be smaller and more reusable
4. Coding Standards and Conventions: (2)
  - Coding standards seems to be ok
  - Consistency of code seems to be also alright
5. Coding Standards and Conventions: (2)
  - UI seems to be well separated
  - It was enough understandable
  - There were some problems which were related mainly to Godot than to code itself
  - The final grade is 2 points.
